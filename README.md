# WizardSchoolOOP
OOP Python project that simulates a wizard school akin to Hogwarts, complete with houses, wizards, and magical interactions.

Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry
Project Overview:
Welcome to the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry! This Python project is a programming representation of a magical school where young wizards and witches receive their education. The school is divided into houses, each housing a distinct group of students. In this enchanting world, we'll explore the interactions and properties of these magical entities.

Project Structure:
The project consists of several key Python files:

school.py: Contains the implementation of the School class, representing the entire Hogwarts School. This class handles the sorting of students into different houses and other school-related activities.

house.py: Represents the House class, which defines the characteristics and attributes of each house at Hogwarts. Each house contains its unique group of students.

wizard.py: Defines the Wizard class, which is responsible for creating and managing young wizard students. These students are assigned to one of the four houses: Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, or Slytherin.

guider.py: Represents the Graduate Wizard class, signifying the transition of a wizard from student to a graduate.

main.py: The main Python script where the magic happens. It initializes the school, houses, and wizards and showcases their interactions.
